# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.


An extensive Data Analysis was executed to data-1-1-3-StarterBook basis to provide insights to increase success rate of new Theather and Music kickstartes at the US and GB.

## US 

![Outcomes Based on Launch Date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52433867/133910765-52246f5f-a6b8-49a7-9c5a-19d464f72bf7.png)


Insight: The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart.

Insight: Failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than successful Kickstarter campaigns. 

## GB

![Box and Whisker Plot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52433867/133910912-37995236-d839-4780-9385-b7d14583bfbe.png)

Insight: From these plots, we can see that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged.
